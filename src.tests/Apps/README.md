# Application Tests

We recommend evaluating two possible types of tests

1. Integration Tests: Which will test the controller's usage and their expected results. Ideally, we should use as much real infrastructure as possible.

2. Acceptance Tests: These will be implemented following the same spirit of integration ones but using Gherkin syntax and as much of the domain language as possible
